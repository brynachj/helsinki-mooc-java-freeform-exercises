# Freeform Exercises From Helsinki Java MOOC

A great way to learn Java (and programming in general) is the MOOC provided by the University Of Helsinki - Object Oriented Programming With Java. The course is available here: http://mooc.fi/english.html http://mooc.fi/english.html

Part 2 of the course has a number of free form exercises that leave the structure of the application to the student.
I have completed the following exercises and included the provided instructions:

[Exercise 8: Airport](src/main/java/mooc/airport/)

[Exercise 16: Ski Jumping](src/main/java/mooc/skijumping/)

[Exercise 26: Phone Search](src/main/java/mooc/phonebook/)
